I embarked on my academic journey fueled by a profound passion for unraveling the complexities of biochemistry. Graduating with a BSc in Medical Laboratory Sciences from Jimma University in 2013, I commenced my career at the College of Medical and Health Science, Haramaya University, as a Graduate Assistant.

My commitment and dedication were quickly recognized, propelling me to the role of Assistant Lecturer within a year. During this time, I immersed myself in the vibrant academic environment, fostering a deep-rooted interest in exploring the intricacies of medical biochemistry.

Haramaya University entrusted me with an incredible opportunity to pursue my Master's in Medical Biochemistry at Addis Ababa University. March 2018 marked the culmination of this enriching chapter as I proudly received my MSc, returning to my alma mater as a full-time Lecturer of Biochemistry and a devoted researcher.

Throughout my academic journey, I've passionately pursued research endeavors, culminating in the publication of seven impactful research papers. These contributions delve into varied facets of biochemistry, each publication representing a milestone in my quest to expand the frontiers of knowledge in this field.

I continue my scholarly pursuits at Haramaya University, driven by an unwavering commitment to advancing biochemistry education and contributing meaningfully to the scientific community.


*Thank You!*
